# AWS-S3-bucket-policyexploration

AWS S3 Bucket Policy Exploration.

Objective: Is to learn how to create an S3 bucket on the AWS management console, explore the basics of S3 bucket policies and their components, create a custom bucket  policy to control access and upload and retrieve objects.

-I started by creating the S3 bucket on AWS management console and named it S3-policyproject.
-I added necessary permission like not giving the bucket public access.
-After that I went ahead to create the Json policy.
-The Json policy created was not successful until I had to change the access permission before the policy was added.
-I went ahead to upload a file on the bucket and it was successful.
-I tried opening the file and it opened
-I tested using allowed ip address
-I tested too with deny ip address
-I also tested with another IAM user.
